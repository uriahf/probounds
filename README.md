Estimating Bounds for Probabilities of Causation

The core ideas for `probounds` draw on Scott Muller's research on *benefit bounds*,
which provides a rigorous framework for evaluating causal benefit.
You can read more in [his overview of benefit bounds](https://example.com/muller-benefit-bounds)
and explore implementations in his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scott-muller).
